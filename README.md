# Project Description

#	A Wheat Exporter Company wants to analyze the Countries which fall in the same range of Export and which don’t. They also need to know which Countries Export is Low and can be improved and which Countries are performing very Well across the years. What they need is a repeatable solution which won’t get affected no matter how much Data is added across time and that they should be able to explain the Data across years in Less number of Variables. Our objective is to cluster the countries based on Various Sales Data across years
